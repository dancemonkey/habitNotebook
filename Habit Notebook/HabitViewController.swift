// This must have a datasource variable that PageVC will set when it loads this instance.
// This must set that datasource to the propert view outlets in a ViewWillAppear method.
// So I will also need a data model to hold the data for each "habit"...
// ... and to construct an array of habits that will be called and loaded into the appropriate Content VC (this file)
